\section{About The Team}

\subsection{Tamara}
My name is Tamara Gonzalez Ibarra, but you can call me Tamy! I am a 4/4 Software Engineering major who is passionate about open-source projects, and my favorite programming languages are Python and Rust. Outside of class, I enjoy being involved on campus with clubs such as LAA, SHPE, and IEEE. I am excited to learn more about DevOps in this course and gain hands-on experience working with Docker and other platforms. 

\subsection{Sydney}
I'm Sydney Winstead, a senior Software Engineering student. Some things I enjoy are Python, Godot, and Drum and Bass music. I have some experience with Kanban Boards (Trello) and Linux, but that is as far as my DevOps knowledge currently goes. I am looking forward to learning more!

\subsection{Michelle}
My name is Michelle Elias Flores (she/her), and I am a senior Computer Science major interested in studying DevOps to learn how different Agile processes work together. My favorite programming languages are Python and PL/SQL, and I am excited to work with Docker.
