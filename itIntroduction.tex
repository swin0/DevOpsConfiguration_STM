\section{About The Team}

\subsection{Tamara}
My name is Tamara Gonzalez Ibarra, but you can call me Tamy! I am a 4/4 Software Engineering major that is passionate about open-source projects, and my favorite programming languages are Python and Rust. Outside of class, I love being involved on campus with clubs such as LAA, SHPE, and IEEE. I am excited to learn more about DevOps in this course and gain hands-on experience in working with Docker and other platforms. 

\subsection{Sydney}
I'm Sydney Winstead, a senior software engineering student. Some random things I like are Python, Godot, and Dnb music. I've had some experience with Kanban Boards (Trello) and with Linux but that is as far as my DevOps knowledge currently goes. Looking forward to learning!

\subsection{Michelle}
My name is Michelle Elias Flores (she/her) and I am a senior Computer Science major interested in studying DevOps to learn more about how different Agile processes work together. My favorite programming langauges are Python and PL/SQL and I am excited to work with Docker.
