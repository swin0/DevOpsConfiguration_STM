\section{Project Description}
Our group project for DevOps Principles and Practices is a web-based endless runner game called \textbf{Everscape}. The player will control a character that runs infinitely through a side-scrolling environment, avoiding increasingly challenging obstacles, and collecting doubloons for bonus points. Users will compete for high scores, which will be securely stored in a backend database. Application security (e.g., preventing score tampering) and pipeline security (e.g., scanning Docker images) will be a focus.
The project aims not only at delivering an engaging and aesthetically pleasing gaming experience but also to integrate DevSecOps practices throughout the development lifecycle. 

\section{Sample Tasks}
\textbf{Game Development}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Build the endless runner game logic (jumping, collision detection, scoring).
    \item Create a frontend interface for the player.
    \item Develop a backend service for storing scores.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{DevSecOps Integration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Source Control: Github for version control, pull requests, and branching.
    \item Containerization: Docker to containerize the frontend, backend, and database services.
    \item Databases: Deploy a lightweight containerized database (e.g., MySQL) for  scores.
    \item Testing: Write unit tests (e.g., collision detection, score validation) and integration tests (e.g., API endpoints).
    \item CI/CD Pipeline: Set up GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy containers automatically.
    \item Hosting: Deploy to a containerized environment (AWS ECS or Docker Compose locally).
\end{itemize}
